# To use this program, you will need to source the lighting DLL yourself.
Install Logitech G HUB, navigate to `C:\Program Files\LGHUB`, and copy `sdk_legacy_led_x86.dll` to this project's directory.

## This will only work on OpenITG and NotITG v3.1.
Other versions got the lighting the wrong way round, so it won't work there. For safety, [get NotITG](https://notitg.heysora.net).
